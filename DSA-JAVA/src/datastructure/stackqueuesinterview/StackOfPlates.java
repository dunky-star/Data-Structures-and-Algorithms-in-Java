/**
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of Cups. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds
 * some threshold. Implement a data structure StackOfCups that mimics this. StackOfCups
 * should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one
 * exceeds capacity, StackOfCups.push() and StackOfCups.pop() should behave identically
 * to a single stack (that is, pop( ) should return the same values as it would if there
 * were just a single stack).
 *
 * Follow Up:
 *
 * Implement a function popAt (int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific
 * sub - stack.
